# Transport

This specification defines an HTTPS binding which MUST be implemented by a compliant PDP.

Additional transport bindings (e.g. gRPC) MAY be defined in the future in the form of profiles, and MAY be implemented by a PDP.

## HTTPS Binding

### HTTPS Access Evaluation Request
The Access Evaluation Request is an HTTPS request with `content-type` of `application/json`. Its body is a JSON object that contains the Access Evaluation Request, as defined in [](#access-evaluation-request).

### Error Responses
The following error responses are common to all methods of the Authorization API. The error response is indicated by an HTTPS status code (Section 15 of [[RFC9110]]) that indicates error.

The following errors are indicated by the status codes defined below:

| Code | Description  | HTTPS Body Content |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| 400  | Bad Request  | An error message string |
| 401  | Unauthorized | An error message string |
| 403  | Forbidden    | An error message string |
| 500  | Internal error | An error message string |
{: #table-error-status-codes title="HTTPS Error status codes"}

Note: HTTPS errors are returned by the PDP to indicate an error condition relating to the request or its processing, and are unrelated to the outcome of an authorization decision, which is always returned with a `200` status code and a response payload.

To make this concrete:

- a `401` HTTPS status code indicates that the caller (policy enforcement point) did not properly authenticate to the PDP - for example, by omitting a required `Authorization` header, or using an invalid access token.
- the PDP indicates to the caller that the authorization request is denied by sending a response with a `200` HTTPS status code, along with a payload of `{ "decision": false }`.

### <span class="nlgov-del">Request Identification</span>
<span class="nlgov-del">All requests to the API MAY have request identifiers to uniquely identify them. The API client (PEP) is responsible for generating the request identifier. If present, the request identifier SHALL be provided using the HTTPS Header `X-Request-ID`. The value of this header is an arbitrary string. The following non-normative example describes this header:</span>

<pre class="http example nlgov-del" id="request-id-example" title="Example HTTPS request with a Request Id Header">
POST /access/v1/evaluation HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM
<span class="nlgov-del">X-Request-ID: bfe9eb29-ab87-4ca3-be83-a1d5d8305716</span>
</pre>

### <span class="nlgov-del">Request Identification in a Response</span>
<span class="nlgov-del">A PDP responding to an Authorization API request that contains an `X-Request-ID` header MUST include a request identifier in the response. The request identifier is specified in the HTTPS Response header: `X-Request-ID`. If the PEP specified a request identifier in the request, the PDP MUST include the same identifier in the response to that request.</span>

<span class="nlgov-del">The following is a non-normative example of an HTTPS Response with this header:</span>

<pre class="http example nlgov-del" id="example-response-request-id" title="Example HTTPS response with a Request Id Header">
HTTP/1.1 OK
Content-type: application/json
<span class="nlgov-del">X-Request-ID: bfe9eb29-ab87-4ca3-be83-a1d5d8305716</span>
