# Features
The core feature of the Authorization API is the Access Evaluation API, which enables a PEP to find out if a specific request can be permitted to access a specific resource. The following are non-normative examples:

- Can Alice view document #123?
- Can Alice view document #123 at 16:30 on Tuesday, June 11, 2024?
- Can a manager print?
